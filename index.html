        <h3>Welp, all hell has broke loose on earth. Everyone is slinging bombs at each other in huge quantities and some happen to find their way into your land. As a passionate farmer, you have to save your sheep from becoming a pile of roasted meat. Control the farmer using the arrow keys. Picking up your sheep doesn't mean you have saved it. You have to bring it back to your barn to keep them safe!</h3>
